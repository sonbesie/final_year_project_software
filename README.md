# Final Year Project: Management Interface

## Description
The desktop management interface for my final year project. This program controlled each of the camera modules placed above the finish line in each lane. Communication was established using a custom network protocol.

## Open
The project can be compiled by opening the .pro file in Qt Creator. The project depends on OpenCV4 to compile.
